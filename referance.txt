What is an Argument?

Argument is a value that is passed to a function when it is called

EX:
def say_my_name(name): # here name is an Argument "which is added to the function"
    print(name)

say_my_name("sainaveen")


What is implicit return?
A function is returned values without using the return keyword is known as implicit.
EX:
sum2 = lambda a, b: a+b
# lambda arg1, arg2:<exp>
greet = lambda greet, name: f"{greet} {name}"
print(greet('aloha', 'Naveen'))
print("This is the value of the sum2 of lambda function:",sum2(5,30))


'''
Assertions allow you to test the correcrness of your code by checkingif some specific conditions remain true,
which can come in handy whileyou're debugging code
'''

Ex:
# testing your code /unit tests

def test_sum():
  assert sum(1,2) == 3, "sum(1,2) does not return 3 like it should"
  assert sum(-20, 20) == 0
  assert sum(20,20) == 40
  assert sum(560, 780) == 1340
  print('sum function: All Tests passed (2/2)')
test_sum()

def test_calulate_food_total():
  assert calculateFoodTotal(100, 20) == 120

test_calulate_food_total()

# List:

👉 lists are used to store multipule items in asingle variable

👉 List have the ability to contain different data types inside of them


# Append:
Adds an element at the end of the list

# indexing
Indexing in python is a way to refer the individual items within an iterable by it's position

# DICTIONARY

Dictionary is a key, is aunique identifier for some item of data, and the value, is either the data that is identified or apointer to the location  of that data
Dictionary 👉 can only have unique key values inside

# set
A set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements. you also can't call the 0th element of a SET


# Mutable
list and dictionary are Mutable, mutable is a type of a variable that can be changed.

# concatenating

concatenating 2 arrays essentially means joining 2 arrays together with their values


### SPECIAL KEYWORDS ##
python keywords are special reserved words that have specific meaning and pursoses and can't be used for anything but those specific purposes.
EX: list, len, max, min ,append, pop, reversed...etc


# in Operator

The in operator returns true if the specified property is in  the specified object it's prototype chain

# set()

The set() function will turn an array into a set
EX: set([1,2,3,4,5])
output: {1,2,3,4,5}

# function unique()
stores the values ruby, ruby, python and onlly returns unique values
EX: ''' unique(['ruby', 'ruby', 'python'])'''

# for loop
for loop is used for iteraring over a sequence (That is either a list, atuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string)
EX:
for i  in range (10):
    print(i)


# while loop
A while Loop is used to iterate over a block of code as long as test expression (condition) is true.

# Traversal

Iteraring throught the loop is called Traversal

EX:
fruits = ['🍎','🍌','🍊','🍏','🍪']

for fruit in fruits:
  print(fruit)
print("_____________________________")
for i in fruits:
  print(i)

# Enumerate()

The enumerate() function takes a collection(eg: atuple) and  returns it as an enumerate object. The enumerate() function adds a counter as the key of the enumerate object

👉 The built-in enumerate() function allows you to loop over a list of items while keeping track of the index value in a separte variable

# Tuple unpacking
unpacking tuples means assigning individual elements of a tuple to multiple variable


# (not(!) symbol)

The (!=)is defined as not equao to operator. it returns True if operands on either side are not equal to each other, and return False if they are equal.


# Pseudocode

Pseudocode is a detailed descriptiom of what a computer program or algoritham must do,
expressed in english rather than in a programming language. in order to simplify understanging.



# Map()

The map() function takes two inputs as a function and an iterable aobject,
the function that given to map() is a normal function, and it will iterate over all the values present in the ierable object given
